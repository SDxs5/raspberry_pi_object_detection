# raspberry_pi_object_detection
Combine the Picamera with a Raspberry_Pi to do the real-time object detection.

Need install files in requirements.txt before running Ras_dec.ipynb

You may choose whatever model you want from tensorflow model_zoo

Download the one you want and change some of the parameters in Ras_dec.ipynb
