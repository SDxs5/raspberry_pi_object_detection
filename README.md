# raspberry_pi_objection_detection
Combine the picamera with raspberry pi to do the real time object classification.

Need install files in requirements before running Ras_dec.ipynb

You could also choose whatever  model you want from tensorflow model_zoo

Doadload the one you want and change some of the parameters in Ras_dec.ipynb
